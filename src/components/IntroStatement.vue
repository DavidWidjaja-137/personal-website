            Welcome, I'm David!

            <i>Selamat datang, nama saya David!</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a graduating Engineering Physics student at The University of British Columbia(UBC), 
            and an incoming Renewable Energy Analyst at Clir Renewables. Feel free to check out my CV and my 
            Tech Blog for a list of things I have worked on. 
        </p>

            I am pursuing a career in renewable energy in particular and climate change mitigation in general. 
            I hope to be able to contribute in some part to the technologies and policies driving energy grid 
            decarbonization, particularly in developing countries. A topic of particular interest to me is how 
            data science and novel control schemes can improve the performance and availability of power plants 
            and energy grids. Check out my Renewable Energy Blog to see the work I am doing in this field, and 
            other interesting stuff I come across. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have a personal blog. I'll probably write stuff about my home country, book and movie reviews, 
            piano and violin, and random philosophical and political thoughts.
